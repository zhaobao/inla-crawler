We inevitably hope we can do as many tasks as possible in a limited time. So we choose to multitask by shifting our focus from task A to task B or even more tasks. During this process, the brain has to refocus again and again, which will increase the cognitive burden. After a few hours of multitasking, most people can't complete all the tasks well. Subsequently, the body is tired, and the brain is fried.\n\nIn addition, a recent study conducted by Stanford University discovered a negative relationship between chronic multitasking and working (and long-term) memory. In other words, if we get used to multitasking, we may find it harder to remember goal-relevant information[^1].\n\nYou may say, \"I don't have enough time to complete the tasks one by one.\" Actually, if you try to prioritize your tasks accordingly and only focus on one task at a time, you will achieve your goals more effectively. To some extent, multitasking lowers our intelligence. Researchers from York University found that students who were multitasking on laptops during a class had lower scores on comprehension tests compared to those who did not multitask[^2]. In terms of the brain structure, chronic multitasking decreases the gray-matter density in your anterior cingulate cortex, which will negatively influence the ability of cognitive control[^3].\n\n![](https://pics.tide.moreless.io/scenes/Fh8YwPX4hERHxlOcglZ5nSIZslTk?imageView2/1/w/1920/h/1056)\n\nBut even you know it is good to focus on one thing at one time, you may notice it is not easy to do so. There are many distractions from the surroundings or your inner mind, which grab your attention constantly.\n\nA bit hot or cold, noise around you, unorganized desk, and people who bother you, all these external distractions will reflect on your brain. If your brain is not habituated to them, they will keep distracting you from your tasks and make you consume more energy to identify them.\n\nSometimes, even though we are in a great environment for focusing, we still feel uneasy and have difficulty sitting quietly for a while. You are more sensitive to the changes around you. For example, people are walking through the room from time to time. You did not notice it in the past, but today you feel too anxious because of it. So you may move to another place, which does not help you to stay focused. Then, you should be aware of whether you are influenced by internal distractions.\n\nStart from the body. You can feel your body to see if you are experiencing bodily discomfort. Or, are your moods swinging because of thoughts and other things? These mental processes will stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, which increases the heartbeat and muscle tension.\n\nSo how to stay away from these distractions? The following is a list of 5 tips to help you get rid of them and transform yourself into a state of focus and concentration.\n\n1. Find a suitable environment for yourself to stay focused more easily.\n2. *Do Not Disturb* mode. Turning off your notifications and avoiding talking to others.\n3. Deep breathing. Taking a few sets of deep breaths and let the length of inhalation longer than the length of exhalation. This can calm you down quickly by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system[^4].\n4. Prioritization with a clear hierarchy of importance. Arranging your tasks accordingly, and giving up less important things, can help you utilize your time and energy more effective.\n5. White noise. You can choose a sound that makes you feel peaceful from various sound scenes in *Tide* app.\n \nWith a prepared state of the mind and body, setting a time and turning yourself into the 「FOCUS」mode, let yourself fully immersed in doing your tasks.\n\n>Author: EVEN\n>\n>Photo: Unsplash\n\n\n[^1]: Uncapher, Melina R., Monica K.

We inevitably hope we can do as many tasks as possible in a limited time. So we choose to multitask by shifting our focus from task A to task B or even more tasks. During this process, the brain has to refocus again and again, which will increase the cognitive burden. After a few hours of multitasking, most people can't complete all the tasks well. Subsequently, the body is tired, and the brain is fried.\n\nIn addition, a recent study conducted by Stanford University discovered a negative relationship between chronic multitasking and working (and long-term) memory. In other words, if we get used to multitasking, we may find it harder to remember goal-relevant information[^1].\n\nYou may say, \"I don't have enough time to complete the tasks one by one.\" Actually, if you try to prioritize your tasks accordingly and only focus on one task at a time, you will achieve your goals more effectively. To some extent, multitasking lowers our intelligence. Researchers from York University found that students who were multitasking on laptops during a class had lower scores on comprehension tests compared to those who did not multitask[^2]. In terms of the brain structure, chronic multitasking decreases the gray-matter density in your anterior cingulate cortex, which will negatively influence the ability of cognitive control[^3].\n\n![](https://pics.tide.moreless.io/scenes/Fh8YwPX4hERHxlOcglZ5nSIZslTk?imageView2/1/w/1920/h/1056)\n\nBut even you know it is good to focus on one thing at one time, you may notice it is not easy to do so. There are many distractions from the surroundings or your inner mind, which grab your attention constantly.\n\nA bit hot or cold, noise around you, unorganized desk, and people who bother you, all these external distractions will reflect on your brain. If your brain is not habituated to them, they will keep distracting you from your tasks and make you consume more energy to identify them.\n\nSometimes, even though we are in a great environment for focusing, we still feel uneasy and have difficulty sitting quietly for a while. You are more sensitive to the changes around you. For example, people are walking through the room from time to time. You did not notice it in the past, but today you feel too anxious because of it. So you may move to another place, which does not help you to stay focused. Then, you should be aware of whether you are influenced by internal distractions.\n\nStart from the body. You can feel your body to see if you are experiencing bodily discomfort. Or, are your moods swinging because of thoughts and other things? These mental processes will stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, which increases the heartbeat and muscle tension.\n\nSo how to stay away from these distractions? The following is a list of 5 tips to help you get rid of them and transform yourself into a state of focus and concentration.\n\n1. Find a suitable environment for yourself to stay focused more easily.\n2. *Do Not Disturb* mode. Turning off your notifications and avoiding talking to others.\n3. Deep breathing. Taking a few sets of deep breaths and let the length of inhalation longer than the length of exhalation. This can calm you down quickly by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system[^4].\n4. Prioritization with a clear hierarchy of importance. Arranging your tasks accordingly, and giving up less important things, can help you utilize your time and energy more effective.\n5. White noise. You can choose a sound that makes you feel peaceful from various sound scenes in *Tide* app.\n \nWith a prepared state of the mind and body, setting a time and turning yourself into the 「FOCUS」mode, let yourself fully immersed in doing your tasks.\n\n>Author: EVEN\n>\n>Photo: Unsplash\n\n\n[^1]: Uncapher, Melina R., Monica K.

Nevertheless, by the time we go to bed, our minds remain too busy and active to fall asleep. \n\nHow to have a good sleep? Try these four methods I will show you.\n\n## 01. Stay away from electronic devices before bed\n\nWould you use your phone or other electronic devices on the bed?\n\nAs the interest of using phones on bed grows, the devices' detrimental effects on sleeping quality develop.\n\nFindings show that the blue light (short wavelength light; SWL) exposures from electronic devices disrupts human sleep, biological rhythms, and even the attention abilities in the next morning as it inhibits the secretion of melatonin in our bodies.\n\nIt's like the brain's signal to the body \"it's time to sleep\" is delayed, causing sleep disturbances.\n\nBeing exposed to blue light for a long time, people will have an intermittent sleep, waking up an average of 6.7 times, and often feel tired and have bad moods during the day. [^1]\n\nTo avoid the impact of blue lights, the first step you can do is to keep yourself away from watching electronic screens at night.\n\n![](https://pics.tide.moreless.io/scenes/FofiFKa5XSkPW7Acwf2R00HWI5MQ?imageView2/1/w/1920/h/1056)\n\nYou can read a book or listen to ambiance music, lowering the dependence on electronic devices.\n\nYou can also set a shutdown alert for your devices, such as turning off automatically 90 minutes before bedtime. If you don't have enough self-control and will turn the machine back on, then try not to bring the devices into the bedroom.\n\nIf you want, you will find a way to stay away from your devices before bed.\n\n\n## 02. Create a nice sleeping environment\n\nHave you noticed that every time you stay in a hotel or stay over at a friend's house, you may not sleep as easily as at your home?\n\nIt's not your illusion.\n\nStaying in a familiar place does allow us to slow down and gently come to rest.\n\nIf the sleeping environment is created \"just right\" to meet the needs of sleep, you will find it not difficult anymore to get quality sleep.\n\n![](https://pics.tide.moreless.io/scenes/FrtAAsCoAzDLs6ndPDTuOg5Fv_wD?imageView2/1/w/1920/h/1056)\n\n### 💡 Light\n\nOur eyes, sensing the different intensity of light on day and night, will communicate with the brain to determine whether the body enters the state of sleep.\n\n Bright light is taken as a signal of daytime, while dim light and night remind the body that it's time to rest.\n\nTo improve your sleep, try preparing yourself a warm night or adjusting the light at the room.\n\n\n### 🛏 Bed\n\nThe bed is where your whole body is softly lying all night.\n\nTrust me, a clean and cozy bed places the foundation of your quality sleep. \n\nFor your mattress, quilt, or pillow, carefully choose the material that suits you to ensure that you sleep well.\n\n\n### 🎼 White Noise\n\nHave you ever noticed that each time when it's raining outside, you can always sleep better?\n\nOur hearing system is like the guard for our bodies. Even if you are sleeping, it keeps reacting towards the sounds outside.\n\nBut the continuous and soft sound of raining is like an invisible mask. It makes all other noises fade away to the background. With the dimmer light on the cabinet, you will gradually become peaceful and relaxed. Even if you have insomnia, you can fall asleep quickly as well.\n\nMany sounds of nature are white noise, such as the sounds of rain and waves. They are soothing and rhythmic. They can help to block many other noises, which can disrupt your sleep.\n\n\n### 🍃 Scent Diffuser\n\nIf possible, you can turn on a scent diffuser, allowing the joyful scent to soothe you slowly.\n\nFor example, the linalyl acetate and linalool hid in the natural lavender oil can gradually calm down your nervous system and decrease the epinephrine. So it can help you to adjust your emotions and reduce stress.\n\n## 03. Take a deep breath and calm down\n\nWe always believe that at the moment we arrive home, we can eventually take a break after a busy working day. However, we usually find ourselves trapped in the matters that happened during the day or the worries about what will happen tomorrow as we lay in the bed. These prevent us from getting rid of the tension and exhaustion caused by a long day.\n\nWhy not spend some time to relax fully? Try releasing all the burdens and stress within the body and immersing in the complete peace and calmness.\n\n![](https://pics.tide.moreless.io/scenes/FkXfYGMDV_tiSboSztUsnHZf1w2L?imageView2/1/w/1920/h/1056)\n\nYou can rest your attention on your breaths. Take some deep and soothing breaths with a 4-7-8 breathing method to unwind yourself.\n\nHere's the way:\n\n1. Let your lips part. Breathing out entirely through your mouth.\n2. Close your mouth. Breathing in with your nose as you count to 4 in your head, letting yourself to get in more oxygen;\n3. Hold your breath for 7 seconds, leaving enough time for the oxygen to get into your body;\n4. Breathing out with your mouth slowly as you count to 8. By doing so, you can fully release all the carbon dioxide in your body and reduce the degree of sympathetic nerve excitement.\n\nThe 4-7-8 breathing method is designed by Medical Dr. Andrew Weil from Harvard University. It forces the mind and body to focus on regulating the breath, rather than replaying your worries when you lie down at night. \n\nThis is particularly designed to bring the body into a state of deep relaxation if you are experiencing sleeplessness.\n\nWith 4-7-8 breathing, let yourself fully feel your body sensations with the bed, and feel your head's connection with the pillow and be aware of anything you can see or smell in the room. \n\nWhen you enjoy each detail of the moment, you will ease into sleep gradually.\n\n## 04. Accept that you cannot sleep\n\nOne of the reasons people experience sleeplessness comes from the worry of insomnia itself.\n\nLying on the bed, checking what time it is frequently, and counting how long you can sleep before waking up. You may take as many ways as possible to force yourself falling asleep quickly.\n\nThe worry and anxiety within these actions for insomnia itself is the main reason you can't fall asleep.\n\nWhat you need to do is to let go of all these fleeting thoughts. There is no need to think about why you stay away. Accept whatever state you are as it is.\n\nIf you like, you can visit Tide's Sleep page. Here, we offer you selected sound scenes and meditation practices to relax fully. Pick one and let yourself gradually easing into sleep, little by little. \n\nBesides the four ways of having a good sleep we introduced, here is a checklist of 10 things you can try step by step fo get quality sleep.\n\n1. Control the amount of Caffeine you intake 6 hours before sleeping\n2. Take a comfortable shower to release the tensions inside the body\n3. Read a book slowly to calm your mind\n4. Listen to the soothing melody, feeling your heart is getting calm bit by bit\n5. Dimming the room lights to create a restful environment\n6. Place your electronic devices aside and imagine that all of your fleeting thoughts can be placed aside as well.\n7. Slightly stretch your body to the extent you feel comfortable\n8. Set the alarm with soft music for a great morning\n9. Take a couple of deep breaths, slowly join into\n10. Gently close your eyes and take a great sleep\n\nDon't take sleeping as a purpose. Take it as a state you will naturally reach. For whatever feelings arise when you go to bed, carefully pay attention to them. Gradually, you will sleep soundly.\n\nIt doesn't matter if your daily routine is complicated and fussy. Each night when you release all your exhaustion and lie down comfortably on your bed, it must be a pleasant and enjoyable moment.\n\nHave a sweet dream.\n\n>Author: Amy\n>\n>Photo: Unsplash\n\n\n[^1]: Green, A., M.

Take a deep breath and calm down\n\nWe always believe that at the moment we arrive home, we can eventually take a break after a busy working day. However, we usually find ourselves trapped in the matters that happened during the day or the worries about what will happen tomorrow as we lay in the bed. These prevent us from getting rid of the tension and exhaustion caused by a long day.\n\nWhy not spend some time to relax fully? Try releasing all the burdens and stress within the body and immersing in the complete peace and calmness.\n\n![](https://pics.tide.moreless.io/scenes/FkXfYGMDV_tiSboSztUsnHZf1w2L?imageView2/1/w/1920/h/1056)\n\nYou can rest your attention on your breaths. Take some deep and soothing breaths with a 4-7-8 breathing method to unwind yourself.\n\nHere's the way:\n\n1. Let your lips part. Breathing out entirely through your mouth.\n2. Close your mouth. Breathing in with your nose as you count to 4 in your head, letting yourself to get in more oxygen;\n3. Hold your breath for 7 seconds, leaving enough time for the oxygen to get into your body;\n4.

Accept that you cannot sleep\n\nOne of the reasons people experience sleeplessness comes from the worry of insomnia itself.\n\nLying on the bed, checking what time it is frequently, and counting how long you can sleep before waking up. You may take as many ways as possible to force yourself falling asleep quickly.\n\nThe worry and anxiety within these actions for insomnia itself is the main reason you can't fall asleep.\n\nWhat you need to do is to let go of all these fleeting thoughts. There is no need to think about why you stay away. Accept whatever state you are as it is.\n\nIf you like, you can visit Tide's Sleep page.

Nevertheless, by the time we go to bed, our minds remain too busy and active to fall asleep. \n\nHow to have a good sleep? Try these four methods I will show you.\n\n## 01. Stay away from electronic devices before bed\n\nWould you use your phone or other electronic devices on the bed?\n\nAs the interest of using phones on bed grows, the devices' detrimental effects on sleeping quality develop.\n\nFindings show that the blue light (short wavelength light; SWL) exposures from electronic devices disrupts human sleep, biological rhythms, and even the attention abilities in the next morning as it inhibits the secretion of melatonin in our bodies.\n\nIt's like the brain's signal to the body \"it's time to sleep\" is delayed, causing sleep disturbances.\n\nBeing exposed to blue light for a long time, people will have an intermittent sleep, waking up an average of 6.7 times, and often feel tired and have bad moods during the day. [^1]\n\nTo avoid the impact of blue lights, the first step you can do is to keep yourself away from watching electronic screens at night.\n\n![](https://pics.tide.moreless.io/scenes/FofiFKa5XSkPW7Acwf2R00HWI5MQ?imageView2/1/w/1920/h/1056)\n\nYou can read a book or listen to ambiance music, lowering the dependence on electronic devices.\n\nYou can also set a shutdown alert for your devices, such as turning off automatically 90 minutes before bedtime. If you don't have enough self-control and will turn the machine back on, then try not to bring the devices into the bedroom.\n\nIf you want, you will find a way to stay away from your devices before bed.\n\n\n## 02. Create a nice sleeping environment\n\nHave you noticed that every time you stay in a hotel or stay over at a friend's house, you may not sleep as easily as at your home?\n\nIt's not your illusion.\n\nStaying in a familiar place does allow us to slow down and gently come to rest.\n\nIf the sleeping environment is created \"just right\" to meet the needs of sleep, you will find it not difficult anymore to get quality sleep.\n\n![](https://pics.tide.moreless.io/scenes/FrtAAsCoAzDLs6ndPDTuOg5Fv_wD?imageView2/1/w/1920/h/1056)\n\n### 💡 Light\n\nOur eyes, sensing the different intensity of light on day and night, will communicate with the brain to determine whether the body enters the state of sleep.\n\n Bright light is taken as a signal of daytime, while dim light and night remind the body that it's time to rest.\n\nTo improve your sleep, try preparing yourself a warm night or adjusting the light at the room.\n\n\n### 🛏 Bed\n\nThe bed is where your whole body is softly lying all night.\n\nTrust me, a clean and cozy bed places the foundation of your quality sleep. \n\nFor your mattress, quilt, or pillow, carefully choose the material that suits you to ensure that you sleep well.\n\n\n### 🎼 White Noise\n\nHave you ever noticed that each time when it's raining outside, you can always sleep better?\n\nOur hearing system is like the guard for our bodies. Even if you are sleeping, it keeps reacting towards the sounds outside.\n\nBut the continuous and soft sound of raining is like an invisible mask. It makes all other noises fade away to the background. With the dimmer light on the cabinet, you will gradually become peaceful and relaxed. Even if you have insomnia, you can fall asleep quickly as well.\n\nMany sounds of nature are white noise, such as the sounds of rain and waves. They are soothing and rhythmic. They can help to block many other noises, which can disrupt your sleep.\n\n\n### 🍃 Scent Diffuser\n\nIf possible, you can turn on a scent diffuser, allowing the joyful scent to soothe you slowly.\n\nFor example, the linalyl acetate and linalool hid in the natural lavender oil can gradually calm down your nervous system and decrease the epinephrine.

The sound of rain and waves, even the swirling fans in the summer, has such a feature.\n\nPerhaps you are curious about why we call such sounds as \"white noise\" rather than other colors. Actually, this definition comes from our perception of the white light. \n\nThe white light we always see consists of monochromatic light at different frequencies. Similarly, white noise is mixed by the sounds at different rates. That's why we call it \"white\" noise.\n\t\n![](https://pics.tide.moreless.io/scenes/FilwNtfLrtE1D3Xu_9cm2Gc2hFYS?imageView2/1/w/1920/h/1056)\n\nDoes white noise make people more relaxed and enjoy better sleep?\n\nIn 1990, a randomized trial led by J·A Spencer studied two groups of 20 newborns, between 2 and 7 days old. About sixteen (80% of the test group) fell asleep within five minutes in response to white noise compared with only five (25% of the control group) who fell asleep spontaneously.[^1]\n\nTo some extent, this trial proved an inference in 1984, which means, newborns may feel unfamiliar about the environment. They even feel agitated or want to cry because of such unfamiliar feelings. While the white noise has similarities with the sounds in the womb, so the newborns can quickly calm down in the white noise.[^2]\n\nAs for those people besides the newborns, white noise can still improve their sleep quality.\n\nA plausible reason is a masking effect about the sound. It means each sound can block lower sounds. You can imagine such a scene. On a quiet night, you almost fall asleep. Suddenly, a sharp honking breaks the silence. How do you feel about it? Perhaps you will become too alert to fall asleep. \n\nBut if you are playing white noise in the room, the situation will become different. We are easy to be awakened by those abrupt sounds because these sounds may stimulate the cerebral cortex and cause excitement in the nerve center. But white noise can effectively mask those abrupt and sharp sounds. It can prevent our hearing system from the interruptions of those sounds.\n\nSome other experiments are working on diverse explanations to prove the effects of the white noise. An experiment led by the Office of the Scientific Research in Peking University recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 6 subjects in the brain synchronization test. The whole experiment procedure was divided into five blocks in the alternative feeding process of 10-min quiet and 10-min noise. \n\nAfter the complexity analysis of the fractal dimension, it is found that the complexity of the EEG signals decreased with the introduction of the white noise exposure, showing the brain waves tended to synchronize with the white noise induction to reach a low level. \n\nBesides this experiment, researchers recruited 40 subjects for sleep quality experiments. The test group slept in the white noise environment, while the control group slept in a quiet environment. After two consecutive experimental periods, the test group showed significant enhancement in the percentage of stable sleep time compared to the control group based on the analysis of electrocardiography (ECG) signal with cardiopulmonary coupling approach. Therefore, it is inferred that white noise can significantly improve sleep quality.[^3]\n\n![](https://pics.tide.moreless.io/scenes/Fu-xUq2ePJ40_HvXnoTUq0VmUeyS?imageView2/1/w/1920/h/1056)\n\t\nWe all know that a sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes. Each night we may have four to five sleep cycles. We usually move through five stages of sleep: wakefulness, light sleep, intermediate sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The first four stages make up our non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and the fifth stage is when rapid eye movement (REM) sleep occurs.\n\nA report in 2010 led by Vincenzo and Stuart further explained the reason why the white noise can improve sleep quality. The study showed that the slow waves in NREM sleep could be considered as the result of intricate interactions of three cardinal oscillators: a salient cortical oscillator based on synapses and two inherent thalamic oscillators. \n\nConsidering that those three oscillators could be stimulated simultaneously by specific auditory input, it may mean that the neurons in thalamus might be synchronized with pink noise in a low oscillating frequency band, which is somewhat like stochastic resonance phenomenon, so that slow rhythm could dominate the brain waves to make people have low-level complexity and a more solid sleep when they exposed to white noise.[^4]\n\nIn total, increasing researches are proofing the positive effects of white noise to our life.
